## Project Introduction

This project is designed to develop a comprehensive and efficient database system to manage the diverse and extensive data needs of Monash Hospital. The primary goal is to create a robust database infrastructure that facilitates the storage, retrieval, and management of crucial hospital data, including patient information, medical procedures, doctor specializations, cost centers, and medical items. The conceptual and logical models are built using Oracle SQL Developer, and the corresponding schema is tranformed to be used by Microsoft SQL Management Studio for Database Creation and further Database Management.

By implementing this database, Monash Hospital aims to enhance its data management capabilities, streamline operations, improve data accessibility, and ensure data integrity and security.

## Database Design and Schema Creation

<a name="db-create"></a>
### Logical Model
- Defining the database schema, including tables, columns, data types, and constraints to accurately represent the hospital's data requirements using the following logical model:

![logical_model]()

### Database Creation in SSMS
- Creating tables for various entities such as patients, doctors, medical procedures, cost centers, and medical items.
- Establishing relationships and constraints between tables to ensure data integrity and enforce business rules.
- Populating the database with initial sample data to validate the schema and demonstrate the system's capabilities.
- Providing comprehensive documentation, including the database schema, data dictionary, and user guides to support database management and usage.

> The following snaps are samples. Please refer to SQL files in Hospital directory for complete script.

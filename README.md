## Project Introduction

This project is designed to develop a comprehensive and efficient database system to manage the diverse and extensive data needs of Monash Hospital. The primary goal is to create a robust database infrastructure that facilitates the storage, retrieval, and management of crucial hospital data, including patient information, medical procedures, doctor specializations, cost centers, and medical items. The conceptual and logical models are built using Oracle SQL Developer, and the corresponding schema is tranformed to be used by Microsoft SQL Management Studio for Database Creation and further Database Management.

By implementing this database, Monash Hospital aims to enhance its data management capabilities, streamline operations, improve data accessibility, and ensure data integrity and security.

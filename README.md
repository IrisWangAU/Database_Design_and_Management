## üî¨ Project Overview 

Walmart is the biggest retail store in the United States. Just like others, they have been expanding their e-commerce part of the business. By the end of 2022, e-commerce represented a roaring $80 billion in sales, which is 13% of total sales of Walmart. One of the main factors that affects their sales is public holidays, like the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 

In this project, I build a ETL data pipeline for the analysis of supply and demand around the holidays, along with conducting a preliminary analysis of the data.
